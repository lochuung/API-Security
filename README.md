# API Security Best Practices Implementation

This project demonstrates the implementation of API security best practices based on the [API Security Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/best-practices/api-security).

## Key Security Features

1. Authentication & Authorization
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Secure session management

2. Data Protection
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Request rate limiting
   - Data encryption in transit (HTTPS)
   - Secure password hashing

3. API Security Controls
   - CORS configuration
   - Security headers implementation
   - Request size limits
   - API versioning

4. Security Monitoring
   - Request logging
   - Error handling
   - Security audit trails
   - Rate limit monitoring
